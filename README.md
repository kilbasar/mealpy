Reserve your meals on MealPal automatically, as soon as the kitchen opens.
Never miss your favourite MealPal meals again!

## Description
*[MealPal](https://www.mealpal.com/edmundmok) offers lunch and dinner subscriptions giving you access to the best restaurants for less than $6 per meal.*

This script automates the ordering process by allowing you to specify your desired restaurant and pickup timing in advance. Just run the script before the MealPal kitchen opens at 5pm to get your order, and beat the competition to getting the meals from popular restaurants!

## Notes
This is a personal fork/mod of https://github.com/edmundmok/mealpy

It adds command line options, and in general does things a little differently
